# Session Log

## Goal

The goal of this session was to continue the development of the `innovate` library by implementing the features outlined in the roadmap.

## Difficulties Encountered

I have encountered a persistent issue with the test environment that has prevented me from making progress on the project. The issue is that the `numpy` package is not being found in the test environment, even though I am installing it with `pip`.

I have tried several different approaches to fix this issue, and none of them have worked. I have tried:

*   Installing the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
*   Installing the dependencies directly with `pip`.
*   Setting the `PYTHONPATH` to include the `src` directory.
*   Running the tests with `python -m pytest`.
*   Deleting and recreating the test files and directories.
*   Creating a new virtual environment.

I am still getting a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'` error.

I have also encountered a `ValueError: fp and xp are not of the same length.` error when running the benchmarking script. This is because the `cov_values` array is not the same length as the `t_eval` array. I have tried to fix this by modifying the `benchmark.py` script and the `scipy_fitter.py` file, but I am still getting the same error.

I believe that there is something wrong with the test environment that is preventing me from making progress on the project. I am not sure what is causing this issue, but I am not able to proceed with the current plan.

## Next Steps

I have created a new branch for the causal model and I have reverted the changes on the main branch. I have also created a new plan to address the issue with the test environment. I will start by trying to create a new virtual environment in a different way. If that does not work, I will try to use a different test runner. If that does not work, I will ask for help from the user.

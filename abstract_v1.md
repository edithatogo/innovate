**Background:** The diffusion of innovations is a complex process that is influenced by a wide range of factors. Mathematical models of diffusion are a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the spread of innovations, but they are often difficult to implement and use.

**Methods:** We have developed `innovate`, a Python library for simplifying innovation and policy diffusion modeling. The library provides a flexible and robust framework for modeling the complex dynamics of how innovations, technologies, and policies spread over time. It is designed for researchers and practitioners in economics, marketing, public policy, and technology forecasting.

**Results:** The `innovate` library includes a suite of focused modules for specific modeling tasks, including foundational single-innovation adoption curves (Bass, Gompertz, Logistic), technology replacement and generational products (Fisher-Pry, Norton-Bass), market share dynamics between competing innovations (Lotka-Volterra, Multi-Product Diffusion), the Gartner Hype Cycle, and the impact of public sentiment. The library also includes tools for agent-based modeling, network-based diffusion, and counterfactual analysis.

**Conclusions:** The `innovate` library is a powerful and flexible tool for modeling the diffusion of innovations. It is designed to be easy to use and extensible, and it can be used to model a wide range of real-world scenarios.

## Session Summary: 2025-07-11

### Goal
Continue development of the `innovate` library, focusing on implementing advanced models and features as outlined in the `todo.md` file.

### Key Activities

1.  **Norton-Bass Model Implementation:**
    *   Researched and selected a robust formulation for the Norton-Bass model's system of differential equations.
    *   Implemented the `differential_equation`, `predict`, `initial_guesses`, `bounds`, and `fit` methods in the `NortonBassModel` class.
    *   Wrote unit tests for the `NortonBassModel` to ensure its correctness.

2.  **Circular Import Refactoring:**
    *   Identified and resolved a circular import issue between the `base` and `utils` modules.
    *   Refactored the code by moving the `get_fit_metrics` function from the `DiffusionModel` base class to the `model_evaluation` module.

3.  **Documentation and Housekeeping:**
    *   Created a `lab_book.md` to document the development process and key decisions.
    *   Updated the `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new features and changes.
    *   Consistently updated the `todo.md` file to track progress.

### Outcome
The Norton-Bass model for generational substitution has been successfully implemented and tested, marking a significant step forward in Phase 4 of the project roadmap. The codebase has been improved by resolving a circular import, and the project's documentation is up-to-date.

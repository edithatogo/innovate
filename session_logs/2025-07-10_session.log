**Goal:** Synthesize previous research and user-provided information to create a comprehensive, long-term roadmap and a concrete set of next steps for the `innovate` library.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Synthesis:**
    *   Reviewed and integrated suggestions from a provided conversation with another AI, focusing on advanced models (Norton-Bass, covariate-driven), fitting techniques (Bayesian, global optimization), and architectural best practices (backend abstraction, scikit-learn API).
    *   Combined these insights with my own prior research into diffusion-substitution models and Bayesian fitting frameworks.

2.  **Strategic Planning:**
    *   Formulated a new, multi-phase roadmap that builds on the completed work. The new roadmap prioritizes a robust fitting and preprocessing framework (Phase 3) before moving on to more complex models (Phase 4) and performance enhancements (Phase 5 & 6).

3.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `roadmap.md` to reflect the new, comprehensive long-term vision for the library.
    *   Updated `todo.md` to provide a clear, actionable checklist for the immediate next steps in **Phase 3: Advanced Fitting & Preprocessing**.

**Outcome:** The project now has a clear, ambitious, and well-structured long-term plan. The immediate next steps are clearly defined, focusing on the critical areas of model fitting and data preprocessing to make the library more robust and practical for real-world applications.

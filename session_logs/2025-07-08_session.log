# Session Log: 2025-07-08

## Summary of Activities

This log summarizes the key activities performed during the session on 2025-07-08.

### Initial Setup & Licensing
-   Created an Apache 2.0 `LICENSE` file.
-   Created an empty `todo.md` file.

### Publishing to PyPI & GitHub (v0.1.1)
-   Incremented project version to `0.1.1` in `pyproject.toml`.
-   Built the source distribution and wheel using `python3 -m build`.
-   Published the package to PyPI using `twine`.
-   Attempted to create a GitHub release, which involved:
    -   Diagnosing and correcting the git remote URL from `doughnut` to `edithatogo`.
    -   Resolving a git push failure due to email privacy settings by re-authoring the commit and tag.
    -   Successfully pushing the commit and `v0.1.1` tag.
    -   Creating the GitHub release using the `gh` CLI.

### Conda Publishing Attempt
-   Installed `conda-build`.
-   Created a `meta.yaml` recipe for the project.
-   Fixed a build failure by adding `setuptools` and `wheel` to the build dependencies.
-   Successfully built the conda package.
-   Installed `anaconda-client`.
-   Attempted to upload to Anaconda.org, but it failed due to a "User does not exist" error for the username `edithatogo`. The user instructed to skip this step after a retry.

### Project Vision & Roadmap Refinement
-   The user provided extensive research and a detailed vision for the library's future, focusing on a modular architecture (`diffuse`, `compete`, `substitute`, `hype`, `fail`, `adopt`).
-   Updated `roadmap.md` to reflect the new modular vision and phased development plan.
-   Swapped the order of Phase 4 and Phase 5 in the roadmap as requested.
-   Updated `todo.md` with a concrete set of actionable tasks based on the new roadmap.

### Codebase & Documentation Audit
-   Confirmed that the concept of converting a diffusion curve (CDF) to a probability distribution (PDF) was already implemented via the `predict_adoption_rate` method.
-   Received and acknowledged directives to prioritize computational efficiency (vectorization) and use the `pyarrow` backend for pandas.
-   Added `pyarrow` to the project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
-   Performed a full audit of repository documentation, creating `CHANGELOG.md`, `agents.md`, and `gemini.md`.
-   Updated `README.md` to align with the new project vision.
-   Committed all documentation changes to the repository.
-   Created this session log file as per the user's request.

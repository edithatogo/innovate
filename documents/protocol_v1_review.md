# Innovate Development Protocol v1 - Peer Review

## Overall Impression

This is a solid first draft of a development protocol. It covers all the key areas of the software development lifecycle and adheres to best practices. The protocol is well-structured and easy to read. However, there are a few areas that could be improved.

## Specific Feedback

### 1. Introduction

-   The introduction is a bit brief. It would be helpful to add a sentence or two about the goals of the `innovate` library and the target audience.

### 2. Version Control

-   The branching strategy is good, but it would be helpful to add a section on how to handle hotfixes.
-   The section on commits is good, but it would be helpful to add a link to a more detailed guide on how to write good commit messages.

### 3. Testing

-   The section on TDD is good, but it would be helpful to add a bit more detail on how this will be implemented in practice.
-   The section on code coverage is good, but it would be helpful to add a section on how to handle cases where it is not possible to achieve 90% code coverage.

### 4. Documentation

-   The section on Sphinx is good, but it would be helpful to add a section on how to handle the documentation build process.
-   The section on docstrings is good, but it would be helpful to add a link to a more detailed guide on how to write good docstrings.

### 5. Release Management

-   The section on semantic versioning is good, but it would be helpful to add a section on how to handle pre-releases.
-   The section on the release process is good, but it would be helpful to add a section on how to handle the case where a release needs to be rolled back.

## Conclusion

This is a good first draft of a development protocol. With a few minor improvements, it will be an excellent guide for the development of the `innovate` library.

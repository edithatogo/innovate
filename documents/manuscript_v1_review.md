# Manuscript v1 - Peer Review

## Overall Impression

This is a good first draft of a manuscript. It is well-structured and provides a good overview of the `innovate` library. However, there are a number of areas that could be improved.

## Specific Feedback

### 1. Introduction

-   The introduction is a bit repetitive. The same information is presented in multiple places.
-   The introduction does not do a good job of motivating the need for the `innovate` library. It would be helpful to add a more detailed discussion of the challenges of modeling the diffusion of innovations.
-   The introduction does not provide a clear overview of the structure of the paper.

### 2. Methods

-   The methods section is a bit thin. It would be helpful to add more detail on the specific methods that are used in the library.
-   The conceptual framework diagram is a good start, but it would be helpful to add more detail to the diagram and to provide a more detailed explanation of the diagram in the text.
-   The descriptions of the models are a bit brief. It would be helpful to add more detail on the assumptions of each model and the types of scenarios that they are best suited for.

### 3. Results

-   The results section is a bit descriptive. It would be helpful to add more analysis of the results and to discuss the implications of the results for researchers and practitioners.
-   The case studies are a bit simplistic. It would be helpful to add more detail to the case studies and to use them to demonstrate the full range of capabilities of the `innovate` library.

### 4. Discussion

-   The discussion section is a bit weak. It would be helpful to add a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the `innovate` library and the future directions of the library.

### 5. References

-   The references section is missing.

### 6. Appendix

-   The appendix is a good start, but it would be helpful to add more detail to the equations and to provide a more detailed explanation of the equations in the text.

## Conclusion

This is a good first draft of a manuscript. With a number of improvements, it will be a valuable contribution to the literature on the diffusion of innovations.
